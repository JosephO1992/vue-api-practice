## My Approach

This was a lot of fun! I haven't worked with Vue in months and that was Vue 3 as well. But this was very enjoyable.

Also, I didn't know whether you literally wanted a table, or would have been okay with divs, however I decided to do with a table in this case just incase.

## Todo

I wasn't sure on a time cap for this. I got the basic app functionality done in 2 hours, I did mess around for a bit trying to get Tailwind set up but it wasn't having any of it. 

Impovements I would make would be:

- More dynamic sort. I would have 1 button for the sort, with either Asc or Desc showing, this would be conditional with a v-if statement, which would get toggled add the end of the sort function. I would then pass in another parameter with the innerHTML displaying on the button we just made responsive. This would then get passed into the sort function and know which attribute in the object to sort.

- With the responsive aspect, I was going down the approach of creating a v-if-"showingDetails", which would be attached to the forks and stars th and tr. Then I would dynamically get the width of the table or screen, which would turn showDetails to true or false. 

- I would install Tailwind and make it look much nicer. I've never actually used tailwind before.
